# About

![Yu Ohno](https://yasmro.vercel.app/ja/about/)

## Yu Ohno

Born in 1996, Nara, Japan.

I specialize in customizing SaaS tools (CRM/SFA/MA), providing technical support through low-code programming and API integration. I also develop frontend applications from scratch using React and Next.js.

I work across various domains—customizing services for specific use cases, developing PoC and prototypes through third-party integration—helping businesses solve problems from multiple angles.

As a hobby, I create artworks that blend calligraphy and web development, and I share them on my portfolio site and Instagram.

## What I Do

### 1. Web Application Development

- **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Python (Django), PHP (WordPress)

I design and build websites and web services using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lately, I’ve been focusing on developing services with React (frontend) and Django (backend), while also learning WordPress (PHP).

### 2. SaaS Automation

- **Tech Stack**: Google Apps Script, Zoho Deluge, REST API

I automate business workflows using low-code tools like Zoho Deluge, Google Apps Script, and REST APIs. I can also implement integrations with third-party SaaS products for streamlined operations.

### 3. Art / Calligraphy

I've been creating calligraphy artworks since 2009 (from my first year of junior high school). During that time, I received over 20 awards and worked on signage for concerts and events. Now, I use brush pens and ballpoint pens, edit the artwork digitally, and share it on Instagram.

## My Vision

### "Kyoushindouhaku" — Feel, Create, and Share Deep Emotion

The Japanese idiom "驚心動魄 (Kyoushindouhaku)" means to move someone’s heart and soul profoundly.

As a highly sensitive person (HSP), I am deeply empathetic and responsive to sensory and emotional stimuli. While I can feel emotionally exhausted by negativity, I also find myself profoundly moved by art and music. I love analyzing and interpreting those emotional experiences, expressing them through my own creative work.

“Emotion” takes different shapes depending on the audience, subject, or scene. My goal is to become someone who can objectively analyze those variables, create something appropriate, and move people emotionally through that creation.
